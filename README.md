# What it is
This is an authorative movement example for Forge Networking Remastered where players can freely move and jump inside the game without lag or rubber-banding until the player deviates from the server and is corrected - also known as "Server Reconciliation". This is a pattern that allows a client to have more crisp and lag-free movement than just interpolating to the players current position on the server. It also means that the player himself is always ahead of the server.

This example also supports actions like jumping, weapon-attacks and the casting of skills to be reconciliated by the server.

# How it works
A step by step example of what is happening:
1) The controlling player saves his input on every frame.
2) The controlling player plays the frames with the input he saved in order to move, jump, attack etc..
3) The controlling player sends his saved frames to the server in certain intervals (ex.: every 5 frames).
4) The server receives the frames and plays them like the controlling player would and saves the results for every frame.
5) The server sends his results back to the controlling player.
6) The controlling player receives the results from the server and compares the frames he played to the frames the server played. If he deviated from the server he _reconciliates_ (he corrects himself based on the results of the server).

# Further Improvements
### Limiting Deviation
Limiting how far the player can be further than the server is usually a good idea. Set yourself a target like "The player is allowed to be 250 frames further than the server". This can be easily achieved by modifying the `InputListenerPlayer` as follows:
```
if (_isOwner && (_listener.CurrentFrame - _listener.AuthorativeFrame) < 250) {
    _listener.SaveFrame();
}
```
When the player is 250 frames ahead of the server he can't send any more inputs, move or take any action before the network stabilizes again. Try it out!

### Interpolation
If you want the example to look more smoothly you can turn on interpolation for `networkObject.position` in the Network Contract Wizard (NCF) of Forge Networking Remastered. This will result in reducing stutter when players see each other move.
